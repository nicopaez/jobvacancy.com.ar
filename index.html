<h1>About</h1>
<p>
<p>This application was developed for training purposes back in 2013. It was initially based on the Job Vacancy Application developed by Matthias GÃ¼nther for the <a href="https://padrinobook.com/" target="_blank">Padrino Book</a>. When I started to work on it I was preparing a XP course focused on technical practices like TDD and CI/CD. Some time later I started using it also in courses at the university.</p>

<p>As training application it has some simplifications that make the application not suitable for "the real world". At the same time, there are some concerns that have been coded following usual "real world" practices even when they may be considered conceptually wrong. Finally there are some things that have been done right.</p>

<p>Since the first commit a long time has passed. Along the years several folks have made contributions, thanks to all of them. The application has evolved in different directions and with different goals.</p>

<p>The application has some things that were implemented "in a nice way". Some other things were intencionally implemented "in a not-so-nice way" in order to allow the students to work on them.</p>	


<h1>Use Cases</h1>
<p>
The Job Vacancy has been use to teach agile software development practices like bdd/tdd, refactoring and ci/cd among others. Beyond that we considered it could be used to teach sftware development practices in general like modeling, oop and design pattern to name a few.
</p>

<h1>Architecture</h1>
<p>The Job Vacancy is a tradicional web application built on Ruby and PostgreSql. It uses the following frameworks/tools: Padrino(web), Sequel(data access), Cucumber, Rspec, Rake and SimpleCov.

Following the Padrino proposal, the application is structured according to the MVC pattern. The persistence is implemented following the Repository pattern.
